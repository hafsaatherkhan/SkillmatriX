        question: "How does SkillmatriX extract skills from my resume?",
        answer: "We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and our proprietary skill-extraction engine to scan your resume text, identifying not just keywords but context, impact, and hierarchy of skills to build a comprehensive profile.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is my personal data and resume secure?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We employ industry-standard encryption. Your resume is processed to extract skills and then encrypted. We do not sell your data to third parties.",
    },
    {
        question: "How does the Intelligent Resume Architect work?",
        answer: "Our AI scans your existing profile and career goals to automatically generate a polished, ATS-friendly resume. It highlights your key achievements and tailors the language to match top industry standards, helping you stand out to recruiters immediately.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I use the AI Career Counselor for interview prep?",
        answer: "Yes! Our AI counselor is trained on thousands of real-world interview scenarios. You can ask for role-specific questions and get feedback on your answers.",

        question: "What makes SkillmatriX different from LinkedIn or Indeed?",
        answer: "While those platforms focus on listing jobs, SkillmatriX focuses on YOU. We provide the 'Why' and the 'How'—identifying what you lack and giving you a roadmap to get there, rather than just showing you jobs you might not be ready for yet.",
